<img src="/Documentation/0.png" width="260">

## Overview

This project is a recreation of the classic game Tetris using C++ and the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game that challenges players to manipulate falling pieces (tetrominoes) to create complete horizontal lines, which then disappear, making room for more pieces.

## Features

- Classic Tetris gameplay with intuitive controls.
- Smooth graphics and animations powered by SFML.
- Score tracking and level progression.
- Next piece preview for strategic planning.
